# GameProject0
This is the main repo for my videogame development class. The projects were open-ended for the students and could be built-upon previous 
game projects. I built a single game incrementally throughout the semester. Go to the "Releases" section of the main repo page and select the latest release
"Submission Release". Download and extract the "FinalGameProject.zip" file and play the game by clicking on the "...\FinalGameProject\netcoreapp3.1\GameProject0" 
executable. View "GameProject0\INSTRUCTIONS.txt" to learn how to play the game.
