Screen shaking occurs when you are shot down

Rotations are randomly applied to the scrolling clouds

Coins will randomly change color every .5 seconds

The alpha blending is implemented in the MenuScreen.cs class only, not the GamePlayScreen.cs class

Blending between clouds is very visible in menu screen 

--UPDATE PROJECT 5
2 3d triangles are rendered as spinning chopper blades in the loading screen

--PROJECT 6 UPDATE

This projected is reimplemented to redo game project 4 such that the tilemap rendered scrolls down on the loading screen
