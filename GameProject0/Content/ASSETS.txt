- note I modified the section of the sprite sheet used in the menu screen to erase part of the sprite

I built upon classes used in previous tutorials, specifically CoinSprite.cs, Collisions/BoundingCircle.cs, Collisions/BoundingRectangle.cs, Triangle.cs, Content/map.txt,  and Collisions/CollisionHelper.cs

I modified the structure of the AduiExample exercise to play the background music and sound effects
